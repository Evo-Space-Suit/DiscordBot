    # author, quote
    ('Buzz Aldrin', 'Mars is there, waiting to be reached.'),
    ('Ray Bradbury', 'Science is no more than an investigation of a miracle we can never explain, and art is an interpretation of that miracle.'),
    ('Gene Roddenberry', "It isn't all over; everything has not been invented; the human adventure is just beginning."),
    ('HAL 9000', 'I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.'),
    ('Arthur C. Clarke', 'Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.'),
    ('Isaac Asimov', 'The saddest aspect of life right now is that science fiction gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.'),
    ('Ray Bradbury', 'We are all children of this universe. Not just Earth, or Mars, or this system, but the whole grand fireworks. And if we are interested in Mars at all, it is only because we wonder over our past and worry terribly about our possible future.'),
    ('Ray Bradbury', 'Whatâ€™s the use of looking at Mars through a telescope, sitting on panels, writing books, if it isnâ€™t to guarantee, not just the survival of mankind, but mankind surviving forever!'),
    ('Buzz Aldrin', 'The first human beings to land on Mars should not come back to Earth. They should be the beginning of a build-up of a colony/settlement, I call it a â€˜permanenceâ€™.'),
    ('Harrison Schmitt', 'It might be helpful to realize, that very probably the parents of the first native born Martians are alive today.'),
    ('John Noble Wilford', 'Mars tugs at the human imagination like no other planet. With a force mightier than gravity, it attracts the eye to the shimmering red presence in the clear night sky.'),
    ('Buzz Aldrin', 'I think humans will reach Mars, and I would like to see it happen in my lifetime.'),
    ('Paul Davies', 'A permanent base on Mars would have a number of advantages beyond being a bonanza for planetary science and geology. If, as some evidence suggests, exotic micro-organisms have arisen independently of terrestrial life, studying them could revolutionise biology, medicine and biotechnology.'),
    ('Andy Weir', "The planet's famous red colour is from iron oxide coating everything. So it's not just a desert. It's a desert so old it's literally rusting."),
    ('John Updike', 'Mars has long exerted a pull on the human imagination. The erratically moving red star in the sky was seen as sinister or violent by the ancients: The Greeks identified it with Ares, the god of war; the Babylonians named it after Nergal, god of the underworld. To the ancient Chinese, it was Ying-huo, the fire planet.'),
    ('Elon Musk', "Mars is the only place in the solar system where it's possible for life to become multi-planetarian."),
    ('Steven Squyres', 'The thing that sets Mars apart is that it is the one planet that is enough like Earth that you can imagine life possibly once having taken hold there.'),
    ('Buzz Aldrin', 'Mars has been flown by, orbited, smacked into, radar inspected, and rocketed onto, as well as bounced upon, rolled over, shoveled, drilled into, baked, and even laser blasted.'),
